# Robust Multi-Fidelity Modelling

This repository contains experiments comparing a **classic multi-fidelity Gaussian process (MF-GP)** model with a **robust multi-fidelity Gaussian process (Robust MF-GP)**.  
The goal is to evaluate whether the robust formulation improves predictions, especially when low-fidelity (LF) data contain anomalies or extreme values. This experiment is performed on spatio-temporal simulated data.

The script "Comaprison_ClassicvsRobust.m" run a comparison between the two approaches. The utilities folder contains the related functions.

## üîç Main Idea

Multi-fidelity Gaussian process modelling combines **high-fidelity (HF)** and **low-fidelity (LF)** data to build efficient surrogates.  
- The **classic MF-GP** works well when LF and HF data are consistent.  
- The **robust MF-GP** is designed to handle situations where LF data may contain **outliers or extreme values**, providing more stable predictions.

We compare the two approaches by looking at:
- **Predictions vs. real HF observations**  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for each method

## üß™ Experiments

### **Spatial Distribution of HF and LF data**

This figure depicts the spatial distribution of the LF and HF data.
In blue the HF spatial location, in red HF points. Each spatial point contains a time-series 
of 100 observations. In blue the correlation coefficients between the LF time-series and the closest HF time-series.
We highlighted with a "star" the test station.

### **Experiment 1 ‚Äî Clean LF data**
In this case, the LF data are relatively well-behaved (no extreme anomalies).  
Even here, the robust model shows slightly better interpolation quality.

### **Experiment 2 ‚Äî Corrupted LF data**
Here, we deliberately introduce **extreme anomalies** into the LF data (multiplying part of the dataset by a large factor).  
The classic MF-GP is strongly affected, while the robust MF-GP maintains much better predictive performance.

## üìä Observations
- **Classic MF-GP**: Sensitive to outliers in the LF dataset.  
- **Robust MF-GP**: Provides more reliable predictions and lower error in both clean and corrupted settings.
