# Here the functions that show how the sensitivity of delta affects the robustness


# README â€” Delta Sensitivity Demo (Huber-robust MF-GP)

This repo contains a **single MATLAB script** that visualizes how predictions from a robust multi-fidelity GP change as you vary the **Huber loss threshold** \(\delta\).

File: `delta_sensitivity_demo.m`  
Purpose: **Fit once with classic likelihood**, then **sweep many fixed \(\delta\)** values for the robust objective and plot how predictions and errors (MAE/RMSE) change.

---

## What the script does

1. **Simulates data** and applies controlled **distortions** to the LF test subset.
2. Builds a global `ModelInfo` used by your GP utilities.
3. Fits **classic** hyperparameters via `fminunc(@likelihood2Dsp, ...)`.
4. For a grid of **fixed \(\delta\)** values, re-fits hyperparameters with  
   `fminunc(@robustObjective2Dsp, ...)` (Huber-robust loss).
5. Optionally, runs one **auto-\(\delta\)** fit using **MAD** scaling.
6. Produces two figures:
   - **Predictions vs. truth** (classic, several robust fits, and auto-\(\delta\)).
   - **MAE/RMSE vs. \(\delta\)** (semilog-x), with reference lines for classic and auto-\(\delta\).

---

## Requirements

- **MATLAB** (R2019b+ recommended)
- **Optimization Toolbox** (for `fminunc`)
- Your utility folders on disk (the script adds them to the path):
  - `Simulation_utilities` (for `simulate_data`, etc.)
  - `ClassicMFGP_utilities` (for `likelihood2Dsp`, `predict2Dsp`, etc.)
  - `RobustMF_Utilities` (any additional pieces you rely on)

> The robust objective (`robustObjective2Dsp`) and Huber helpers (`huberLoss2`, `huberWeights`) are **included at the bottom of the same script**.

## How to run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Ensure the three folders above exist at the paths set in the script.
3. Run:
   ```matlab
   Test_delta_sen.m
